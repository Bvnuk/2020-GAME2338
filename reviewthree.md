### 2 out of 5 stars

## Summary

  This game is about beinmg a cute pixilated cat catching falling hearts.
There isn't much else to the game other than that. You are given a short
amount of time to collect as many falling hearts as you can.
  You can have streaks if you catch hearts within is certain timeframe
of each other. The style is cartoony and kind of sketched looking. There are falling
starts in the background.
  There is an option to play in fullscreen mode which I recommend
because the default playing window is actually super tiny. It's a small square
inside the game window but, it's playable like that too.

## Final Thoughts

  The game was cute for what it is. It's not meant to be a super elaborate 
game that takes you hours however, I did find there are some things that could be 
improved. For example, the streak feature is kind of buggy. In some cases it is 
impossible to continue your streak just because the hearts don't drop quickly 
enough. I think the game is also too consistent there aren't any changed throughout
the game. I know it's short but, I think some varitey could've been added. There 
could've been other objects that fell that you aren't supposed to collect or the
hearts could've fallen faster as time progressed. For these reasons I think this 
game is 2 out of 5 stars.
