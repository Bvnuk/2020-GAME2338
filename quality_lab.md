# Quality Lab

## World of Warcraft 
In my group we went with three different games we both agreed
are good based on certain quality factors. The first game we both
thought fell under a good game was World of Warcraft. For one it has
incredible replayabilty. I've played since it first came out with a 
couple breaks in between as have millions of others and still we
continue to pay the $15 a month for a game thats over ten years old.
There is typically always new content and not so new content that keeps
us interested. There are also very minimal bugs in the game and the 
controls/mechanics are fluid to use. World of Warcraft is also very
personable to you. You can find things you like to do that maybe is 
the complete opposite of what another player does. There's PVP and PVE.
Some people are mythic raiders while others only do PVP. There are 
transmog and mount collectors. There's something for everyone to do.

## The Witcher 3
Another game that falls under what we consider a good game is the 
Witcher 3. The lore in this game is what makes many people die hard
fans. Rather than being the rightous hero you are essentially morally 
grey. This is kind of a turn from other RPG's and games in general which
can be intriguing. The detail in this game is just incredible. For example,
over time if you go without a hair cut you can see your beard and hair 
grow. Walking past NPC's you can sometimes hear glimpses into their lives
of what's going on with them currently. It makes the game that much more 
believable. The range of difficulty is good as well so that a variety
of people are able to play based on their skill.

## Halo 3
A game that is close to my childhood and many others' is Halo 3 and the 
Halo series in general. Although I don't remember the first two well enough
to write a review on them, they were some of my favorites. Halo 3 is a very
iconic game for a few reasons. It had an excellent campaign mode and co-op mode
which is essentially going extinct. The story was great and the ending race against
time would really get my adrenaline going. The online play was so much fun! It
has to be one of my favorite games to play online it never got old to me. 
There were a variety of online games you could play such as slayer or capture the
flag etc. The graphics during that time were amazing. It was very smooth gameplay.
Of course sound plays a major role with the Halo series. Everyone knows the 
Halo theme song because it's something that sticks with us making this another
reason why Halo 3 is an incredible game.
