### 3 Starts out of 5


## Summary
This game is about a father who needs to feed his baby.You're in a castle setting
where 3 parts of milk are scattered and you must find them and get them back
to the baby in 3 minutes or less.There are secret passageways through the grass 
and locked doors you must find the keys to.
The only mechanics in this game are up, down, left, and right, with your
standard movement keyboard controlls. There are little uprgades (soda cans)
that give your character speed boosts. The keys will unlock specific doors but 
you wont be in that room, it tells you which door it just unlocked. There are
also notes scattered throughout the map that are either hints or pointless to
throw you off.
There is a note that says "Keep off the grass," however, you are supposed to search 
through the grass for hidden passageways. There is another note that asks what the
things in the water are. This is to make you think that you need to figure out 
what is in the water and lose time. You can't do anything with the water. There
is also a section about a fairy that isn't part of the objective, just more distraction.
When you collect all 3 pieces of the milk you have to rush back to the baby and feed
it. The door in your home is then unlocked and there are three notes with credits of
the developers.

## Final Thoughts
I thought the game was incredibly short. I understand that it's a speed run
however, I think incorporating a few levels would benefit it. The game itself
was actually pretty fun I found myself enjoying it. I did think the hidden 
grass zones were a little unfair since there wasn't any hints indicating where
they were. The only reason I figured out there were hidden passageways was because
I accidently ran into one. I couldn't find the last one but the developer left
a comment where to find it in the comment section on the webpage. I had to play
a total of 3 times to beat it and I had fun each time. I give it 3 stars just
because it's really short and there aren't and hints to where the passageways are.

## Additional Information
I used the comment section in the game for help and other people seemed to enjoy the game.
I didn't use any other links besides the game's webpage.
