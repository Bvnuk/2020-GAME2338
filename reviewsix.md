### Rating
I rate this game 5 out of 5 stars

## Summary

Breath of the Wild is about the most recent reincarnation of Link and Zelda (that we know
of) and their battle against Calamity Ganon to save Hyrule. The game takes place 100 years
after the original battle against Calamity Ganon. Link was badly injured when Zelda saved him
by putting him in a very long sleep state. He wakes up to our present day in game with no memory
of what happened, where he is, and who he is. He finds an interesting looking tablet which turns
out to be a Shekiah Slate and the answer to all his questions. He runs outside and is shown a 
spectacular view of the world of Hyrule. He's then greeted by a hooded old man who we later discover
is the ghost of the king and Zelda's dad. He sends Link on his way to find Impa, the Chief of Kakariko 
Village, who gives you the details of your quest. You must harness the power of all four of the divine 
beasts and battle Calamity Ganon to save Hyrule. You can go straight away or increase your skill, armor,
and weapons through various shrines and side quests you'll encounter around the world.

## Final Thoughts

I absoulutely love this game. I originally was going to do my review on Genshin Impact but then thought I 
would review the original version of the game since I'm essentially reviewing the same thing.I may be biased
on Zelda games because, I have an undying love for them due to my childhood however; to be fair they are some
of the best games out there. Breath of the Wild is a completely new take on a Zelda game. It's open world and 
has a totally revamped dungeon system if they can even be called that. Zelda games in the past were all about
long complex puzzle dungeons and a linear questline with some side quests along the way, but in Breath of the
Wild there's total freedom on where you want to go and how you want to complete the game. The dungeons in Breath
of the Wild are the four Divine Beasts which are just mechanical animals such as an Elephant etc. They're very short
and only have one boss and a handfull of enemies. There is an ABUNDANCE of side quests in Breath of the Wild that
really distract you from helping Zelda out on your main quest. There's also complete freedom on how you want to 
approach Calamity Ganon. You can literally go fight him as soon as you start the game which I don't recommened, but it's
possible! Or you can complete the game aside from Calamity Ganon 100% and then go approach him. I think the graphics
are absolutely stunning and there's so much little details in the game that really make me love yet another Zelda game.
