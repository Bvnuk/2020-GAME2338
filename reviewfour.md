### 4 out of 5 stars

## Summary

  This game is a basic 2D platform jumper. There isn't any background story
to this game. You are a bunny hopping through levels trying to avoid death,
however you die at the end of each level once you win. A hawk will swoop you
up and eat you.
  Throughout your journey through each level you can collect hidden and not so
hidden carrots. You want to avoid falling of the platforms and staying on certain
platforms for too long because the vanish. There are also spikes in some levels that
are fixed while others fall from the ceilings. 
  There are achievements in each level such as collecting a certain number of 
carrots and completing the level in a specific number of jumps or less. There are also
overall game achievements you can look at in the achievements tab in the main menu. 
In the stats tab you can see number of bunnies lost, amount of jumps made, double hops
and dashes.

## Final Thoughts

  I actually really did enjoy this game. It has a good amount of content. There are 
fifteen levels and each level gradually becomes harder. The tutorials happen throughout
the game depending on which mechanincs are needed for that level that you haven't previously
learned. For example, the first level tells you how to jump and how to make your jump go 
farther. In another level you need to turn left and right throughout the level so it teaches
you that you turn with the "e" key. I also like that there are other things to accomplish 
besides the levels themselves like the achievements. It gives players something to do once 
they finish all the levels. The game also isn't easy. It seems like most platformers are fairly
simple but this one is a little more difficult and has physics to it such as silding down a hill
if you take too long. There also is blood so its not a cutesy game about a bunny which isn't my taste
but for some people that's what they like. I do however, think it is lacking is some areas hence
my -1 star rating. There are some things you have no hint to like the disenigrating platforms. I also
think the jump can be a little buggy it's not very fluid. The game is very fun regardless.
