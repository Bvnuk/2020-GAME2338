## Summary

This game is about little characters saving the world through their cooking.
In Overcooked the Onion Kingdom is under peril from the attack of the evil
spaghetti monster. The Onion king sends you and your party back in time to 
improve your culinary skills to become better prepared to face off with the 
spaghetti monster once again.

You and your friends have to face different hazerdous cooking enviornments and
create delicious meals before your customers become angry. The levels are arranged 
into groups and levels within those groups such as 1-1, 1-2, 1-3 etc. The first 
number defines which setting you're cooking in. There are different enviornments
like pirate ships, space, spooky forests, and icy waters.

Throughout your journey your team must overcome crazy obstacles like slippery
glaciers to avoid falling in the water; jumping from one moving car to the 
other to collect different ingredients, or being isolated from your party in 
opposite rooms where you have to send different items to each other. All while
washing dishes and beating the time limit your customers have given you. 


## Final Thoughts

I absolutely love this game! I think it's so much fun and and its chaos adds
to the thrill. Overcooked is not for the faint of heart, it gets hard especially 
as you progress. There are some levels you feel like you absolutely will not beat.
In order to unlock levels you have to collect a certain amount of stars for that
particular level. Each round you're eligible to collect up to 3 stars depending on 
your score. This causes for a lot of replaying of levels because some of those scores
seem impossible to reach! It really is a lot of trial and error with these levels 
because you have to learn the mechanics with each map and work together with your 
team. Overall I think this game is very fun and I would definitely recommend.
