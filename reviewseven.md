### Card game + War game, by folex70, https://folex70.itch.io/card-game-war-game 

### 1 out of 5 stars 

## Summary  
This game is a card game that I’m assuming is about a war. The cards have images on them of soldiers, grenades, and flags. 
I’m only guessing that because there is not much else to take information from other than what I’m guessing. There is no back 
story that I am able to find other than in the instructions. You have a time limit and the goal is to make your opponent’s life 
reach 0 before your timer runs out. Each turn is thirty seconds. According to the instructions the cards each have a different
ability. You select one card to use for each turn and then click end turn. The green cards modify the field, the pink cards are
a trap card, yellow cards are normal, and orange cards are special. The “major card win(s)” according to the instructions. 

## Final Thoughts  
This game is pretty much not that great. The entire game isn’t even on the screen. I cannot read the messages that pop up on
the top of the screen so I have no idea what is really happening. The instructions do not really make any sense and there are a
lot of grammar errors that make it difficult to read. For example, “if has a other card in enemy field the power of cards are 
compared and the major cards win, dealing damage equals the diference of powers in enemy fields; and - if the enemy field do not
have cards the damage are fully for the players life ponts,” instructions by folex70. I think the game has potential I do like the 
look of the cards. It’s a cute simple game however, there are some major errors that make it difficult to play.
